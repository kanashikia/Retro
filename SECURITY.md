# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a personal/hobby project. While I care about security, please keep in mind that it is maintained on a "best-effort" basis. 

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

1. **Prefer not opening a public issue** for critical exploits.
2. Send an email to [kanashikia26@proton.me](mailto:kanashikia26@proton.me).
3. I will try to look into it when I have time, but I cannot guarantee a specific response timeline.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the `main` branch is actively maintained.
